	A small react native project with Authentication that use Expo CLI

   <i>Due to the EXPO update, I have decided to prioritize updating "<a href="https://github.com/mashwishi/React-Native-Expo-with-TailwindCSS">React-Native-Expo-with-TailwindCSS</a>." I will return to updating this project once I have set up the  <a href="https://github.com/mashwishi/React-Native-Expo-with-TailwindCSS">React-Native-Expo-with-TailwindCSS</a> boilerplate, as I intend to use it as a template for this endeavor. The project is a compact React Native application featuring authentication, utilizing the Expo CLI.</i>
